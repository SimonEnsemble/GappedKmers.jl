# 🧬 `GappedKmers.jl`

this is a Julia package to:
* deal with gapped k-mers
* featurize DNA sequences with gapped k-mer counts
* compute the gapped k-mer kernel between two DNA sequences

✔️ the package is reasonably tested. see `tests/runtests.jl`.

📗 the functions have doc strings. capabilities are outlined and doc strings for each function are printed in the Pluto notebook, `dev.jl`, rendered [here]([https://github.com/SimonEnsemble/GappedKmers.jl/blob/main/dev.html](https://simonensemble.github.io/GappedKmers.jl/dev.html)).
